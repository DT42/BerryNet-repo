# Usage:

# You need to create a secret keyring (secring.gpg).  You can use your
# existing one, or create a new one by doing something like the
# following:
# $ GNUPGHOME=/src/debian/mini-dinstall/s3kr1t gnupg --gen-key
#
# You should then put your passphrase in $GNUPGHOME/passphrase.

set -e

if [ -z "$USER" ]; then
   USER=$(id -n -u)
fi

# User variables
# MAKE SURE TO MAKE THIS DIRECTORY 0700!
export GNUPGHOME=$HOME/.gnupg
# You can get the key ID from current user, set a user, or ID.
#KEYID=$(getent passwd $USER | cut -f 5 -d : | cut -f 1 -d ,)
#KEYID=43FE9005 or "Archive signing key"
# You can set the digest here, keeping in mind apt will reject anything less than 256.
DIGEST=SHA512
